Hi there! :wave: If you're reading this, thank you! You've somehow managed to end at my personal blog. Hope you're going to enjoy it and find the content and articles relevant.
I won't go much into details about me or the blog, please read the blogs whoami[^whoami] section for more about me and what's going on here. This post is simply to mark the date I did the `git init` and started creating this site. Maybe that will be a post in itself how I run that and what customization I've made ( a ton actually, even picked up some Ruby along the way :shrug:).
